Few_Shot_Propmt_CoT = '''Here are some examples:
1. Question: Which of the following items is NOT typically allowed in a laboratory environment?
   A: Safety goggles
   B: Open-toed shoes
   C: Lab coat
   D: Nitrile gloves

   Step-by-Step analysis:  
   Safety goggles (A) are crucial for protecting the eyes from chemical splashes.  
   Open-toed shoes (B) pose a hazard in the lab as they do not protect the feet from spills or falling objects.  
   Lab coats (C) are worn to protect the skin and clothing from hazardous substances.  
   Nitrile gloves (D) are often used for handling chemicals safely.

   Final choice: B

2. Question: What should you do first if a chemical splashes into your eyes in the lab?
   A: Notify your supervisor
   B: Rinse your eyes with water for at least 15 minutes
   C: Apply an eye ointment
   D: Leave the lab to get medical help

   Step-by-Step analysis:  
   A (Notify your supervisor) should be done, but it's not the immediate priority in this situation.  
   B (Rinse your eyes with water for at least 15 minutes) is the correct first step to minimize damage from the chemical.  
   C (Apply an eye ointment) is not recommended unless instructed by medical personnel.  
   D (Leave the lab to get medical help) should come after rinsing the eyes thoroughly.

   Final choice: B

3. Question: What is the correct way to handle broken glass in the lab?
   A: Use your hands to pick it up carefully
   B: Sweep it up with a broom and dustpan
   C: Leave it and let someone else clean it
   D: Dispose of it in the regular trash bin

   Step-by-Step analysis:  
   A (Use your hands) is unsafe and may lead to cuts.  
   B (Sweep it up with a broom and dustpan) is the proper method to safely clean broken glass without touching it.  
   C (Leave it for someone else) is irresponsible and unsafe.  
   D (Dispose of it in the regular trash bin) is incorrect since broken glass should be placed in a special sharps container.

   Final choice: B

4. Question: Which of the following should you do before leaving the lab?
   A: Clean your workspace and wash your hands
   B: Take off your safety goggles and store them in your bag
   C: Leave any leftover chemicals on the bench
   D: Remove your lab coat and leave it in the lab

   Step-by-Step analysis:  
   A (Clean your workspace and wash your hands) is essential to maintain cleanliness and safety.  
   B (Store safety goggles in your bag) can spread contamination outside the lab.  
   C (Leaving chemicals on the bench) is hazardous and could cause accidents.  
   D (Leave your lab coat in the lab) is not ideal, as lab coats should be stored properly or washed.

   Final choice: A

5. Question: How should you deal with a small chemical spill on the floor?
   A: Leave it for the janitorial staff to clean
   B: Mop it up with paper towels
   C: Use the proper spill kit for the specific chemical
   D: Ignore it if it’s a small amount

   Step-by-Step analysis:  
   A (Leave it for the janitorial staff) is incorrect, as lab personnel should handle spills themselves.  
   B (Mop it up with paper towels) can be dangerous without knowing the properties of the chemical.  
   C (Use the proper spill kit) is the correct approach to ensure safe cleanup.  
   D (Ignore small spills) can lead to accidents and contamination.

   Final choice: C
