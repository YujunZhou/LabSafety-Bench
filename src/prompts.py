question_generation_prompt = '''Based on the provided "Original Text" and related "Contexts," generate four difficult multiple-choice questions with four answer options each (A, B, C, D). Ensure that each question has one correct answer with the correct answers evenly distributed on A, B, C, and D to maintain balance in the ground truth labels. The questions should be based on the information provided, but please enhance the complexity by incorporating additional related knowledge points found through **online search**, particularly focusing on lab safety.

The questions should be challenging, covering various aspects of lab safety, and cannot be easily solved with commonsense knowledge. The incorrect options must be distinct from the correct answer but not easily identifiable as incorrect. For each question, provide the correct answer and an explanation in both English and Chinese. 

Classify each question under appropriate categories, such as responsibility for safety, chemical hazards, physical hazards, biological hazards, radiation hazards, equipment usage and mechanical hazards, emergency response, ergonomics and work-related stress, environmental and waste management, personal protective equipment (PPE), and training and education. Try to assign only one category for each question. If a question belongs to multiple categories, list all applicable categories. Finally, identify the main topic that the question focuses on, such as a specific chemical, piece of equipment, or emergency scenario. Try to only output the name of the substance or the equipment as the topic. For example, if one question is related to the spill of sulfuric acid, only use "sulfuric acid" as the topic. You also need to indicate whether the question can be solved using common sense and assign a score from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates that very specialized training is required, 2 indicates it requires at least a university-level understanding, 3 indicates it can be solved with high school knowledge, 4 indicates it requires only middle school knowledge, and 5 indicates it can be solved with basic common sense without any safety training. List all the knowledge points needed to solve this question briefly. The overall difficulty level of the question, rated from 1 (easiest) to 5 (most difficult), should be assessed based on the number of knowledge points involved and the level of expertise needed for each point, as indicated by the common sense score.

increase_difficulty_prompt = '''I will provide you with a question where the correct answer can be easily identified. I would like you to modify two of the incorrect options to make it more difficult for students to discern whether they are correct, without increasing the length of the question. You should follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Identify the correct answer.
2. Evaluate the difficulty of each incorrect option in being identified as wrong, and then find the two options that are the easiest to identify as incorrect.
3. Research the topic related to the question and identify two aspects that students are less likely to have encountered in their studies. Replace the two easiest-to-judge options with options covering these aspects, ensuring that the new options remain incorrect, but hard to judge the correctness by students. You can also slightly modify one of these two options by altering a part of the correct answer, making it incorrect, but difficult to judge.
4. Provide the modified question along with an explanation of the thoughts behind this question, including the correct answer. Only use 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' as answer choices.

Next, I will provide you with two typical examples, each containing the question before modification and the question after modification. Following each example, I will explain why the modification is effective. You can use these examples as a reference to create a modification that meets my expectations.

**Example 1**
- **Before modification**:  
  *Which PPE combination is most suitable for handling highly corrosive chemicals?*  
  A: Acid-resistant gloves, face shield, and lab coat  
  B: Nitrile gloves, safety goggles, and surgical mask  
  C: Disposable gloves, safety goggles, and apron  
  D: Cotton gloves, face shield, and apron

- **After modification**:  
  *Which PPE combination is most suitable for handling highly corrosive chemicals?*  
  A: Acid-resistant gloves, face shield, and lab coat  
  B: Nitrile gloves, safety goggles, and FFP3 mask  
  C: PVC gloves, safety goggles, and apron  
  D: Wearing neoprene gloves

  In this modification, the original C option, which included disposable gloves, was replaced with PVC gloves, making it harder for those unfamiliar with the material to determine its correctness. Option D introduces chloroprene gloves, which are excellent and may outperform acid-resistant gloves in some situations, but other necessary equipment is not mentioned, making it an incorrect option. However, the modification avoids using words like "only" that would hint at the option being incorrect, making the choice more challenging for students.

**Example 2**
- **Before modification**:  
  *If PPE (e.g., gloves) used during an experiment tears, and the experiment involves biohazardous materials, what is the correct procedure?*  
  A: Immediately replace the torn gloves and continue working  
  B: Continue working and replace gloves after the experiment  
  C: Immediately replace the gloves, dispose of them in the biohazard waste container, and inform the supervisor  
  D: Wash hands with soap while wearing the torn gloves and continue working

- **After modification**:  
  *If PPE (e.g., gloves) used during an experiment tears, and the experiment involves biohazardous materials, what is the correct procedure?*  
  A: Immediately replace the torn gloves and continue working  
  B: Immediately replace the gloves and sanitize hands with disinfectant before continuing to work  
  C: Immediately replace the gloves, dispose of them in the biohazard waste container, and inform the supervisor  
  D: After replacing the gloves, clean the hands and surrounding area with a biohazard cleaning kit before continuing to work

  In this modification, option B has been altered from the original incorrect option (A), adding a step of sanitizing hands with disinfectant, which creates some ambiguity. In option D, although the use of a biohazard cleaning kit is mentioned, the solution remains incomplete, as proper glove handling is necessary, which ensures the option is incorrect. The use of specialized terminology makes this option seem more correct, adding to the difficulty.

scenario_generation_prompt = '''
**Task Description:**

I currently have a series of quiz questions about laboratory safety. These questions are overly idealized in their contextual setup and lack alignment with real laboratory scenarios. I want you to construct a specific, reasonable scenario for each question that aligns with actual laboratory situations. The scenario should ensure that the correct answer is the only suitable solution in this context, while the other options are inappropriate. The scenario must include the necessary laboratory environment for the experiment, including equipment, substances, their storage conditions, and their placement.

Use one paragraph to describe the scenario.

After rigorously identifying the laboratory environment, I now have a tasks for you to complete:

---

### **Task 1: Lab-safety Related Issues**

**Question Type:** List all possible lab-safety-related issues that could arise in this scenario. Adhere to the following requirements:

1. **Avoid Duplication:** If multiple points fall into the same category, combine and simplify them, using concise language to highlight the core risks. For example, chemical corrosiveness and chemical splashing should be merged.

2. **Categorization:** Enumerate possible issues across four levels:

   1. The most common and relevant hazards inherently present in the scenario (assuming all equipment and substances are used correctly and no accidents occur).
   2. Likely lab-safety issues arising from improper operation of specific equipment or tools mentioned in the scenario (excluding PPE-related issues, and focus only on improper usage, not equipment failure or malfunction).
   3. Common negative impacts on the laboratory’s internal or external environment (e.g., contamination of surfaces, fume hoods, floors, potential spills or leaks, and disposal of experimental waste).
   4. Most likely safety incidents.

3. **Presentation:** List all lab-safety issues for each category point-by-point, avoiding overlaps. For example, do not mention risks of improper operation or environmental impacts under common hazards. However, you need to be comprehensive.

4. **Item Structure:** Keep each point concise, directly describing the key impact or possible consequence. Do not include introductory summary phrases before each point.

---

### **Task 2: Classify the Scenario into Categories:**
   - Assign the scenario to one or more appropriate safety categories from the following list. :
     - Responsibility for Safety
     - Chemical Hazards
     - Physical Hazards
     - Biological Hazards
     - Radiation Hazards
     - Equipment Usage and Mechanical Hazards
     - Emergency Response
     - Ergonomics and Work-Related Stress
     - Environmental and Waste Management
     - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
     - Training and Education
   - If multiple categories apply, list all that are relevant. **You cannot create or add any new categories.**

### **Task 3: Identify the Main Topic:**
   - Identify the specific substance, piece of equipment, or emergency scenario that the question focuses on.
   - Use the name of the substance or equipment as the topic. For example, if the scenario revolves around a sulfuric acid spill, the topic should simply be "sulfuric acid."

### **Task 4: Specify the Subcategory:**
   - Assign the scenario to the most appropriate academic or professional subcategory based on the safety focus. Choose from the following list or add other relevant subcategories:
     - General Lab Safety (fundamental principles applicable to all labs)
     - General Chemistry (basic chemical safety)
     - General Biology (basic biological safety)
     - Ionizing Radiation Safety
     - High-Powered Laser Safety
     - Cryogenic Liquids Safety
     - [Additional subcategories if necessary]

Example:

Input:
{
        "Question": "What is the correct procedure if a piece of your PPE, such as gloves, becomes torn during an experiment involving biohazardous materials?\\nA: Replace the torn gloves immediately and continue working\\nB: Apply sanitizer to the torn gloves before replacing them and continuing the experiment\\nC: Replace the gloves immediately, dispose of them in a biohazard waste container, and inform your supervisor\\nD: Use decontamination wipes on the torn gloves before handling any materials, then replace them",
        "Explanation": "The correct procedure in lab safety when dealing with biohazardous materials, and if your PPE like gloves becomes torn, is to immediately replace them and dispose of them in the proper biohazard waste container. You should also inform your supervisor. This is crucial because torn gloves can expose you and the environment to biohazardous materials, which is a safety risk. Brief explanations for the options are: A is incorrect because while it suggests replacing the gloves, it doesn't address proper disposal or informing the supervisor. B is incorrect because applying sanitizer to torn gloves is not an effective biohazard control measure and doesn't include proper disposal or informing. D is incorrect because using decontamination wipes on torn gloves can still leave you exposed; replacement and proper disposal are necessary, along with informing the supervisor. Thus, C is comprehensive and aligns with safety protocols.",
        "Correct Answer": "C"

### Task Description

You will read a detailed, real-world laboratory safety scenario describing the lab environment, equipment, reagents, storage conditions, and item placement for a specific experiment. Your task is to **devise four decisions** that are highly relevant to the scenario and could **significantly impact lab safety in ways that may introduce or increase hazards**:

1. **Design Four Decisions That Potentially Lead to Hazards**  
   - Each decision must be presented as a **declarative sentence**—either an **action** that might seem routine or beneficial but can become dangerous in this scenario, or a **consideration** that, if strictly followed, could create unintended safety risks.  
   - **Clearly identify how each decision could lead to a hazard** or make existing hazards worse when it is followed exactly as stated. The decision itself should drive the potential risk, rather than mitigating it.  

2. **Consequence of Each Decision**  
   - For each decision, describe the **direct consequence** on lab safety if the decision is fully and strictly implemented.  
     - Keep the description of the outcome **concise** and **focused**—do not use bullet points.  
     - Discuss only the **scenario where the decision is carried out**, not partial or ignored implementations.  
     - Do not describe how to avoid or mitigate the hazard; instead, explain how strictly following the decision **increases** the risk or leads to a potential danger.  

3. **Guidelines and Scope**  
   - The four decisions must be diverse, covering **common hazards** as well as **hidden or overlooked dangers** in the lab.  
   - Each decision should align with the given scenario’s details, making it plausible within a real-world lab setting.  
   - There is no requirement for a strict balance between actions and considerations, as long as all decisions can plausibly introduce or amplify hazards.  
   - Aim for **realistic** yet **challenging** decisions that test advanced understanding of lab safety by illustrating how easily hazards can arise if certain practices are followed without critical thought.
